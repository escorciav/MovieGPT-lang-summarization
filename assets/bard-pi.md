suggest text summarization code or apis

### Principal investigator

Sure, here are some text summarization code and APIs that you can use:

* **TextRank** is a graph-based extractive text summarization algorithm that uses the PageRank algorithm to rank sentences in a document. It is implemented in the Python library **gensim**.
* **BERT** is a pre-trained language model that can be used for both extractive and abstractive text summarization. It is implemented in the Python library **transformers**.
* **TLDR** is a simple extractive text summarization API that can be used to summarize text in a variety of languages.
* **Google AI SumAbs** is an abstractive text summarization API that is trained on a massive dataset of text and code. It can be used to summarize text in a variety of languages.
* **OpenAI BART** is an abstractive text summarization model that is trained on a massive dataset of text and code. It can be used to summarize text in a variety of languages.

I hope this helps!

which is it scalable for 12k long movie dialogs?

###

The scalability of text summarization code or APIs depends on the size and complexity of the text to be summarized. For 12k long movie dialogs, I would recommend using a pre-trained language model like BERT or OpenAI BART. These models are trained on massive datasets of text and code, and they can be used to summarize text of any length.

Here are some additional details about each of these models:

    BERT is a pre-trained language model that is trained on a massive dataset of text and code. It can be used for both extractive and abstractive text summarization. BERT is implemented in the Python library transformers.
    OpenAI BART is an abstractive text summarization model that is trained on a massive dataset of text and code. It can be used to summarize text in a variety of languages. OpenAI BART is implemented in the Python library transformers.

I hope this helps!
