# Can AI displace irrelevant Research PIs?

As our favorite PIs are getting more and more ~~irrelevant~~ busy 🙃, we are wondering if we can replace them with AI.

We tested out the idea with existing available text-based conversational AI models, such as:

- [YouChat](./youchat-pi.md)

- [Google BARD](./bard-pi.md)

- [ChatGPT](./chatgpt-pi.md)

We believe it's a great use of tech as some PIs are only available via chat.
**Make your own conclusions.**
Will universities reconsider their tenure policies in the future? 🤔
Supposedly, Meta went for managers in ther 2nd round of laids-off 🤑.
Perhaps, those managers were sacred ~~cows~~ PI's bringing little milk to the farm 🐮🥛.
