### Junior researcher

suggest text summarization code or apis

### Principal investigator

There are several APIs and code libraries available for text summarization. Here are a few options:

    OpenAI GPT: OpenAI's GPT models can be used for text summarization tasks. There are pre-trained models available that can generate high-quality summaries.

    Hugging Face Transformers: Hugging Face offers several transformer models that can be fine-tuned for text summarization tasks. The BART model is a popular choice for this task.

    NLTK Summarization: The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a popular Python library for working with human language data. NLTK's summarize function provides extractive text summarization capability.

    gensim: The gensim library offers several summarization algorithms, including Luhn Summarization, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and TextRank.

    Sumy: Sumy is a Python library for text summarization that supports several summarization algorithms. It also offers built-in support for summarizing text from web pages and documents.

These are just a few options available for text summarization. You can try out different solutions and see which one works best for your use case.

### Junior researcher

which is it scalable for 12k long movie dialogs?

### Principal investigator

I apologize, but none of the search results provided from my previous response are related to 12k long movie dialogs. However, based on the original question about text summarization, it is possible that the intended search query was not initiated correctly. Could you please provide more information about what you are looking for so that I can provide more relevant search results or guidance?

### Junior researcher

have a bunch, around, 12k long movie dialogs to summarize. Which apis or code do you recommend?

### Principal investigator

For summarizing movie dialogs, one approach would be to use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. Here are some libraries and tools that can help with this task:

1. spaCy: spaCy is a popular NLP library that can be used for sentence tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition. It also has built-in support for summarization.

2. Gensim: Gensim is a Python library that provides several summarization algorithms, including SumBasic, LSA, and TextRank.

3. Transformer models: Transformer models, such as GPT and BERT, can also be fine-tuned for summarization tasks. The Hugging Face Transformers library provides easy-to-use APIs for working with transformer models.

4. Neural Monkey: Neural Monkey is a deep learning framework for NLP tasks that includes built-in support for summarization.

5. PyTeaser: PyTeaser is a simple Python library for text summarization that uses the TextRank algorithm.

These tools can potentially handle long movie dialogs, but factors such as the time complexity of the chosen summarization algorithm and the computational resources available may affect the scalability of the solution.

Another option could be to use a cloud-based summarization API service such as Aylien or MeaningCloud, which can scale to handle large amounts of data. These services offer an API that you can use to send text for summarization and receive summary as a response.

I hope this helps!
